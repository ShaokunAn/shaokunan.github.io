I am a post-doc at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, working with Prof. [Martin Hemberg](https://hemberg-lab.github.io). My research aims to developing computational methods to analyze the dynamic and regulatory mechanisms underlying diseases and differential responses to perturbations using high-throughput single-cell data.
