My research focuses on the development of computational methods, incorporating machine learning and statistical techniques to analyze high-dimensional single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. By uncovering the underlying dynamics and mechanisms, I'm particularly interested in exploring how the immune system responds to perturbations and treatments, aiming to provide deeper insights into disease processes and therapeutic outcomes.
